        <button onclick="myFunction1()" class="box1 ">YOU ARE ENOUGH</button>
        <div id="sman1">
            <center> If you really want something to happen, you'll go above and beyond to make it so. On the other hand, if you start to doubt yourself, it's likely that you'll start out justifying your lack of progress to others or to yourself. People can go
                through a moment in their lives where they experience suffering without realizing that they are "comfortable with their troubles, " and when they do tell others about it, they wind up alone because no one can relate to what they are going
                through. Many of you might be curious as to what this looks like and why I am so certain about it.This stage begins with a circumstance when a person is too worn out to take additional measures to solve their issue and begins screaming
                to themselves or others that their life is a wreck and they will never return to their normal life. There are two significant issues with this. First, a person starts to view their current circumstance as fate and keeps blaming others
                for it. Second, a person tells himself or herself unfavourable affirmations, such as that it is impossible for him or her to return to how they were before the incident. Third, he or she might feel as though there is no escape, which would
                influence how they act.He or she must resist acceptance since it causes grief. Time helps the individual heal by allowing them to mature in their response to the circumstance. In this circumstance, the sufferer is not looking to you for
                any sort of assistance; rather, he or she is asking for your assistance so that they can moan about their suffering. He or she might agree with your suggestions since, in his or her opinion, they have already tried them all, and as time
                goes on, the cycle of growing accustomed to an unpleasant circumstance deepens. As time passes and the issue spirals out of control, the individual's thinking becomes dull. People in this condition go for solace in venues where they can
                complain about their circumstances.Once upon a time, a woman's HIV status was determined. Her spouse assumed that she must have been experiencing a great deal of agony or suicidal thoughts. When the spouse considered obtaining the test
                again, it was confirmed that it was negative. The initial test's primary error was the exchange of the woman's blood with that of an HIV-positive hospital patient. His sensible actions or steps refute the entire premise, which states that
                taking one small step is not a huge issue. The story's main lesson is to keep looking for solutions and making an effort, even after you run out of options. God must have a solution for your issues.Additionally, there is a saying that
                goes, "There 's no smoke without fire somewhere." You are enough for yourself, as the title indicates. It implies that each individual possesses the bravery or the drive to leave any circumstance that they are in and finds intolerable.
                It is mandatory to prevent becoming tied to your problem because doing so will have a negative impact on your life for the rest of your life. Instead, he or she should strive to come up with as many suggestions as possible to resolve the
                issue. Third, may God grant you a positive outlook that will enable you to work wonders.Some people might believe that in order to resolve their issue, they require the services of a therapist, counsellor, or psychologist. Some of them
                might go on to see their psychotherapist, but that won't have the same impact on them as the self-realization will. And "you," yes "you," can get out of any circumstance if you are determined to do so. You must keep the motivation to get
                out of that position alive. Sometimes people lose their motivation, have emotional lows, and feel as though no one cares about them or that everyone else is ignoring them. Do not be terrified of it. Everything will be alright, and if you
                focus on finding one way or another to fix the issue, it will be resolved shortly. Any issue can be resolved by you. Nobody can stop you if you only have faith in God and in yourself. ~ `BY VEDANT SAREEN`</center>

        <button onclick="myFunction2()" class="box2">DONT ISOLATE YOURSELF</button>
        <div id="sman2">
            <center> Are you self-sufficient? How much, if at all? I already wrote that you are sufficient, but occasionally people lose their way and begin to accept their circumstances, which can be bad for them. But I questioned What is the upper limit of this
                capacity if everyone is sufficient for themselves? Additionally, there is an issue between us. We often isolate ourselves because we believe we are meant to live alone. People like us can not live in total solitude or freedom. That implies
                that you have to rely on others for things like food, feelings, psychological tension, time management, education, learning, daily living, and so forth. Like other mammals, we humans have evolved in what we refer to as "society."Here,
                you need someone to give you the strength to take charge of your own survival. I want to bring up a significant concern as our conversation continues. This is the distance that separates us. People in today's environment frequently live
                in isolation out of concern that others may not comprehend their experiences and emotions.Although the person in front of you might not be aware of what you are going through, he or she may have sensed your sorrow and will try their best
                to get you out of the situation. You must also be prepared for that in order to fix your problem rather than just complain about it. People frequently cut back on social interaction, and some choose to live alone entirely. Some people
                associate their seclusion with privacy, which is dangerous. After a certain period, they start to feel all alone in their family, and while they are hurting within, there's no one to console them. In actuality, people build a wall of emotions
                and solace to protect themselves from pain, but occasionally this wall is breached, leading to an emotional breakdown. It is stated that because of their attitude and the imaginary world they live in, even if we give them wings to fly
                away or feel free, they will still feel stuck because of their mindset. Even if their issue is not fixed, I would like to suggest to them a remedy where they should interact more. For instance, a person who frequently lives in a box (a
                symptom of a place where they feel cut off from the outside world) is blinded by their cognitive abilities and falls into a trap. However, if he or she interacts more with the outside world, other people's ideas can inspire him or her
                to come up with new ones. Because the person in the box is now exposed to learning and in a condition of acknowledgment in order to solve his or her problem, this technique is occasionally referred to as awakening. ~ `BY VEDANT SAREEN`</center>

        <button onclick="myFunction3()" class="box3">MATURITY OF KNOWING PAIN</button>
        <div id="sman3">
            <center>A human is a creature that serves as the connecting point for any emotion or relationship that binds them together. We also have a tendency to name that bond with each other and specify its limitations. As social beings who have evolved to
                rely on others, people of all ages frequently require mental support or care in order to cope with difficult circumstances or stress. Most of the time, a person receives the tender love, affection, or care they expect, but there's a catch.
                Their expectations rise as soon as their bond gets closer and closer, so when they reach a point where they feel the conversation is not going in the direction they want it to, they may act aggressively and ask you, "Do you even understand
                what I'm going through?" And the majority of people attempt to answer that question in their own way. Many of them don't provide an adequate response, which causes a loss of connection with the person, and the sufferer may experience a
                sense of alienation from the caregiver because they believe that they have changed.In the second scenario, some people may be suffering from multiple illnesses, which may only be temporary but still have a significant impact on them. The
                other people, in their eyes, are merely forcing them to work and not paying attention to their suffering. What should we therefore do in these circumstances? The simplest response to that is to realise that one should choose a mature response
                to another person's suffering. The first step is to make sure the person listening to you is mature enough to listen to what you are saying rather than cribbing. Allow him or her to settle for a while if he or she is not in the right frame
                of mind. In addition, here is an illustration that addresses 90% of the issue. "RAIN" is soothing, calm, and refreshing, and what isn't something that satisfies us? "US" stands for the individual who is a home owner. Ask a beggar who is
                not wearing a hat for the same Because you view rain as a blissful or happy aspect of your life, he might think you're a psychopath. The question is, why do we feel good when he doesn't? It is because we are at ease in a state where the
                pain does not bother us and, in fact, we believe that pain is insignificant for others. Now scream at him, complain aloud in front of him all day, or irritate him with the same phrases. He won't believe you, and you'll get a bad reputation
                for not being able to feel his suffering. In addition, there is a different viewpoint that asserts that everyone is aware of how painful something is. For instance, if a dog bites a friend, I won't be the one putting it through its paces
                to gain experience. In this case, it is implied that both parties are mature enough to comprehend the other's plight. Therefore, one must be mature enough to alter their viewpoint when it is connected to another person's suffering and
                treat them as such. ~ `BY VEDANT SAREEN`

        <button onclick="myFunction4()" class="box4">SILENCE IS THE KEY</button>
        <div id="sman4">
            <center>A huge concern arose in my mind: who is truly at ease with themselves these days and who is well-informed in the new era of relationships? Following our everyday patterns like a donkey who works, sleeps, and enjoys some of the day doesn't
                make us all clumsy and boring, right? Don't we all just need a little push, a little spark, or a new direction to leave this boring lifestyle behind and embark on an adventure filled with excitement? You will need to spend a few more minutes
                reading this post, but I believe it will be time well spent. The statement that completes the requirement for answering the preceding question is as straightforward as one might imagine. The key is to start accepting change and to step
                outside of your comfort zone. "The change" in a new journey to the same goal, the change in a new you , the change from dull you to happy you ,but I guess it's easy to say these lines as compared to really following them. My first essay
                covered why we should not isolate ourselves; in the continuation, I would advise a limited amount of isolation for every individual in his or her life to realise the reality that he or she must know how to exist independently, how to grow
                emotionally mature, emotionally stable, and intellectually strong, and how to understand that he or she can utilise suffering as a source of fuel to fully fulfil his or her purpose. A difficult subject arises here, which is the addition
                of society to the people. For the love of God, stop telling people that you don't care about fucking society. Believe me, you do. It's true what they say—we're all social beings. There were no cell phones in the 1980s. It was perfectly
                acceptable to simply express your feelings in a casual conversation with your first crush, and everyone was happy in no time. However, in today's world, one needs to have a mature mentality in order to find peace in one's life "after the
                above-mentioned time of silence or solitude".If you must work in silence, in an isolated atmosphere, away from the beings you love, from the people you are attached to, and if they ever wanted to favour you back, they would help you to
                feel connected to them even after the extended period of no interaction, because whomever truly loves you wants you to thrive in your life and would also help you achieve that objective by who you are. ~ `BY VEDANT SAREEN`</center>

        <button onclick="myFunction5()" class="box5">DONT BE A WEAKLING</button>
        <div id="sman5">
            <center> People are fragile. Yes, you read that right. Each and every one of us is so frail that we are easily manipulated by others. "Emotions." The main goal for anyone who wishes to dominate another person or treat them as a victim is that they
                need to regulate their own emotions. He or she may attempt to influence, brainwash, or manipulate the victim to serve personal interests, and guess what? People are so gullible that if you listen to them and calmly watch them, their errors
                will be etched like neon signs on their foreheads. The current reader of the post may be one of those people who wishes to attract a different person from their imagination who would value and prioritise them, because that is another mistake
                and immature action that many people take. People demand worth and value and expect it for free. They feel the need for sympathy and think they can rely on the one who feeds the evil of comfort inside of them. In the long run, comfort
                kills. Remember that you should not consider yourself valued in society if you do not work hard. Be a kind person instead of a jerk. Another important issue that individuals have is that they don't comprehend that motivation is like a
                medicine that releases dopamine, which is essentially a happy hormone, for a short period of time. It lasts for several hours, since it lasts until the hormone surge returns to normal. Another explanation is for those who aren't strong
                enough to realise that slashing their wrists or engaging in self-harm is never the answer. You won't find a solution to your issue. Those who think a lot are simply thinking. People who cry or are simply crying are worthless and should
                be regarded as having a value of zero. Nobody desires a bad or weaker father, mother, brother, sister, or child. Making yourself a little more deserving of the people is now the only way to exist and be given priority. ~ `BY VEDANT SAREEN`</center>
